Biohazrd Conceptual Documentation
===================================================================================================

Biohazrd is a framework for creating native binding generators for C and C++ libraries. It aims to lower the amount of ongoing boilerplate maintenance required to use native libraries from .NET as well as allow direct interoperation with C++ libraries without a C translation later.

You may also find it useful to reference [one of the first-party Biohazrd-generated interop libraries](https://github.com/InfectedLibraries?q=Infected&type=source).
